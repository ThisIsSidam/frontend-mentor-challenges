#Frontend-Mentor-Challenges

The repo contains the challenge solutions of my Frontend Mentor challenges. 

This is how it goes. 

- I do a challenge.
- Once it is complete, I wrap it in a new folder and store it in a folder called Storeroom.
- The challenge I'm currently working on will always be on /(root), meaning outside of any folder.
- I'm currently on my first challenge, so there just might not be any folder called the Storeroom.

Have a nice day.
